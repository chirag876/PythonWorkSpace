# Getting Started

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Project Setup](#project-setup)
* [Next Steps](#next-steps)
* [FastAPI](#fastapi)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** Version 3.x is recommended.  Download from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Git:** A version control system. Download from: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **pip:** Python's package installer (usually included with Python).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chirag876/PythonWorkSpace.git
    cd PythonWorkSpace
    ```

## Project Setup

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    Activate the virtual environment:

    * **macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows:**

        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    You should see `(myenv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install Dependencies (if applicable):**

    If a project has a `requirements.txt` file, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Next Steps
After completing these steps, you're ready to explore the projects within this repository.  Refer to individual project directories for specific instructions.
