-> Domain-specific approaches: Handling outliers based on domain knowledge
Impact on Analysis:
-> Statistical measures: Effects of outliers on mean, median, variance, etc.
-> Modeling: Influence of outliers on predictive models and algorithms
Best Practices and Guidelines:
-> When to detect and handle outliers
-> Considerations for outlier detection methods
-> Steps for robust outlier analysis
