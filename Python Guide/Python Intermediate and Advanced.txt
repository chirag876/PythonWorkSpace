### INTERMEDIATE PYTHON TOPICS

 1. Data Structures  
 - Collections module (Counter, defaultdict, namedtuple)
 - Stacks, Queues, Deques (using collections and queue)
 - Linked Lists (implementation using classes) 
 
 2. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)  
 - Classes and Objects
 - __init__, self, instance vs class variables
 - Inheritance, Polymorphism- Encapsulation and Abstraction
 - super() and method overriding 
 
 3. File Handling  
 - Reading/Writing text and CSV files
 - Working with JSON files
 - Context Managers (with statement) 
 
 4. Modules & Packages  
 - Creating and importing your own modules
 - Python Standard Library (os, sys, math, datetime, random, time) 
 
 5. Iterators & Generators
 - __iter__, __next__ methods- yield keyword and lazy evaluation
 - Generator expressions 
 
 6. Decorators  
 - Function decorators
 - Chaining decorators
 - Practical use cases (logging, authentication) 
 
 7. Error Handling (Advanced)  
 - Custom exceptions
 - try-except-else-finally with multiple exception types
 - Raising exceptions in functions 
 
 8. Functional Programming 
 - map(), filter(), reduce() (from functools)
 - zip(), enumerate() deep usage
 - Immutability and pure functions 

### ADVANCED PYTHON TOPICS

1. Advanced OOP  
- @classmethod and @staticmethod
- Dunder/Magic Methods (__str__, __repr__, __eq__, etc.)
- Metaclasses (basic understanding) 

 2. Multithreading & Multiprocessing  
 - Thread vs Process
 - GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) concept
 - threading, multiprocessing modules
 - Using concurrent.futures 
 
 3. Asynchronous Programming  
 - async and await keywords
 - asyncio module
 - Event loops and coroutines 
 
 4. Context Managers & with Keyword  
 - Custom context managers using __enter__ and __exit__
 - contextlib module 
 
 5. Memory Management & Performance  
 - Memory profiling tools (tracemalloc, memory_profiler)
 - Time profiling with timeit
 - List vs generator performance 
 
 6. Type Hinting & Annotations  
 - Basic typing (List, Dict, Tuple from typing module)
 - Custom type hints and static type checkers (like mypy) 
 
 7. Testing  
 - unittest and pytest frameworks
 - Mocking and fixtures
 - Writing testable code 
 
 8. Design Patterns in Python  
 - Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy (Python versions)
 - When and how to apply 
 
 9. Working with APIs & Web Requests  
 - requests module
 - Consuming JSON APIs
 - Handling responses, status codes 
 
 10. File I/O Advanced  
 - Reading large files efficiently
 - Working with Excel/CSV/PDF using libraries like pandas, openpyxl, PyPDF2

### Bonus Topics (Useful as you advance)

- Logging (logging module)
- Virtual Environments & pip
- Using argparse for CLI scripts
- Refactoring and writing clean, maintainable code (PEP8, docstrings)
- Working with databases in Python (sqlite3, SQLAlchemy)
- Introduction to Python with Data Science (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

### Suggested Learning Flow:

1. Start with OOP + File Handling + Collections
2. Then go for Decorators + Iterators + Functional Programming
3. Move to Multithreading + Async + Advanced OOP
4. Finally dive into Testing + Memory Mgmt + Real-world project
