    "**Static Methods:** \n",
    "1. utility method that performs a task in isolation. inside this method we dont use instance or class variable because this method doesnt take any parameters like self or cls. these are bound to class and not the object of the class so we can call it using class name.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. these variables doesnt have access to class and instance variables because it doesnt recieve an implicit first argument like self and cls. therfore it cannot modify the state of the object or class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Static methods are a special case of methods. Sometimes, you’ll write code that belongs to a class, but that doesn’t use the object itself at all. It is a utility method and doesn’t need an object (self parameter) to complete its operation. So we declare it as a static method. Also, we can call it from another method of a class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. these methods can be called using **ClassName.method_Name()**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining static method:** \n",
    "1. we must explicitly tell the python that it is a static method using **@staticmethod** decorator or **staticmethod()** function. these methods are defined in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **@staticmethod** decorator is a built-in function decorator in Python to declare a method as a static method. It is an expression that gets evaluated after our function is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of static method:**\n",
    "1. **Consumes less memory:** Instance methods are object too, and creating them has a cost. Having a static method avoids that. Let’s assume you have ten employee objects and if you create gather_requirement() as a instance method then Python have to create a ten copies of this method (seperate for each object) which will consume more memeory. On the other hand static method has only one copy per class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **To Write Utility functions:** Static methods have limited use because they don’t have access to the attributes of an object (instance variables) and class attributes (class variables). However, they can be helpful in utility such as conversion form one type to another. The parameters provided are enough to operate.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Readabiltity:** Seeing the @staticmethod at the top of the method, we know that the method does not depend on the object’s state or the class state."
